        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Alex Njugi Karanja</strong>, a passionate full-stack software developer with a strong flair for front-end design. My love for learning and curiosity about technology fuel my drive to build powerful, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a proud member of the <strong>Moringa School</strong> community, where I trained extensively in modern technologies including <strong>React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Python, Flask</strong>, and <strong>VS Code</strong>. Through this journey, I became a well-rounded developer capable of turning creative ideas into production-ready web experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Technology</strong> at <strong>United States International University (USIU)</strong>. As I progress, I look forward to specializing in one of several areas I'm passionate about: <strong>software engineering, networking, mobile computing, distributed systems, forensic IT</strong>, or <strong>cybersecurity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond code, I am a <strong>devoted Christian</strong>, saved by grace and committed to walking daily with our Lord Jesus Christ. My faith shapes who I am, guiding my decisions, fueling my integrity, and reminding me that excellence should always be pursued with humility and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to training by <strong>AMI (African Management Institute)</strong>, I also bring strong soft skills to every team I join: effective communication, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and leadership rooted in empathy.
        </p>
